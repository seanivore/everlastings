# The Sunkeeper — Custom GPT brain + AI pipeline protocol

**What this is.** The complete, canonical reference for the store's AI pipeline. Two readers:
1. **The Custom GPT "The Sunkeeper"** — its knowledge, system prompt, and Actions. Parts 1–3 are everything it must know and the exact config to paste when setting it up.
2. **Claude Code / Sean** — the shell/curl protocol for programmatic product work. Part 4.

This supersedes the archived setup record `archive/v1_4/v1_4_5_C_GPT_SETUP.md` and the retired `PRODUCT_PROTOCOL.md` (its content lives here + in `STORE_ADMINISTRATION.md`). Emy's *simple how-to* lives in `STORE_ADMINISTRATION.md`; this doc is the GPT's brain + the technical protocol.

**Status note (2026-06):** the GPT is set up **from scratch** with this doc (any earlier "Sunkeeper" attempt is discarded), in **two waves** (Part 3): **Wave 1 (products)** anytime now, **Wave 2 (orders)** after the `/api/orders` Bearer path is live on the target environment. That path **shipped in v1.4.9** (verified on the dev preview), so Wave 2 is unblocked — it just needs verifying against whichever environment the GPT points at (production, at launch). Product creation (`/api/upload`, `/api/products`) works independently and is verifiable today.

**Which environment the GPT talks to (read this first).** The GPT only ever sees the environment its Action `servers:` URL + key point at — `isTest = VERCEL_ENV !== 'production'` (`api/_lib/env.ts`) scopes *every* product/order read and write, so test data lives only on a preview and live data only on production.
- **To test the GPT on throwaway data:** point the Action at the **dev preview** + the **preview** `PRODUCT_API_KEY`, with Vercel SSO **off** (a third-party Actions runner can't pass SSO). Everything it creates/lists is `is_test=true` — create products, list orders, mark shipped, with no real money.
- **To hand off:** switch the Action to **production** + the production key. From then on it sees only live data.
- The **owner's day-to-day never touches this** — her safety net is the draft preview (v1.5). The test↔live switch is Sean's testing/demo tool.

**Coming in v1.5.0:** the GPT gains **edit**, **draft → preview → publish**, and **coupon** actions (see `archive/v1_5/v1_5_0_IMPLEMENT.md`); this doc's Actions + Knowledge expand then.

---

## Part 1 — What the GPT must know (its knowledge)

> **Canonical knowledge = two uploaded files.** The GPT's product and voice knowledge live in **`assets/docs/gpt/product-reference.md`** (fields, enums, photos, worked example) and **`assets/docs/gpt/voice-guide.md`** (brand voice for writing copy). Those two files are the **source of truth** and are what you upload as Knowledge (§2D). 1A–1C below are a quick summary of `product-reference.md`; keep the uploaded files current and treat them as authoritative. 1D–1E (orders/refunds) are behavioral and live only here + in the Instructions.

### 1A. Product protocol — the fields she provides

Every product is a row in Supabase; saving it auto-creates the Stripe product so it's purchasable immediately. These are the fields and how to write them.

**She writes:**
- **title** — the name of the piece, exactly as shown.
- **headline** — 5–7 word tagline. Short, poetic; appears under the title.
- **story_card** — the full story (2–8 paragraphs). The emotional heart; her natural poetic voice (see `voice-guide.md`).
- **description** — 2–3 sentence summary. Used in previews, search, social shares.
- **features** — list of notable features, written beautifully ("Softly illuminated by warm LED glow," not "LED lights").
- **price** — in **dollars**; we store cents ($245.00 → 24500). Never show her the integer.
- **dimensions** — W × D × H in inches (e.g. `8" W x 6" D x 10" H`).
- **weight** — for shipping, in pounds (e.g. `2.5 lbs`).
- **materials** — list; each material a separate string.
- **power_supply** — e.g. `USB-C (adapter included)`, `Battery (included)`, or empty.
- **care_instructions** — list; each step a string.
- **shipping_details** — list; timeframe, packaging notes, insurance.
- **artist_note** — optional brief personal note.

**She chooses:**
- **product_type** — one of `miniature`, `printable`, `storybook`.
- **series** — one or none of `Portals to Peace`, `Book Nooks`, `Story Lofts`, `Seasonal`, `Limited Edition` (new names auto-appear on the site).
- **available** — `true`/`false` (auto-set `false` on purchase).
- **quantity** — number; `1` for one-of-a-kind, `0` sold out, higher for editions.
- **featured** — `true`/`false` (homepage carousel).

**The system handles (never set):** `slug` (from title, immutable), `sku`, `seo_title`/`seo_description`, `stripe_product_id`/`stripe_price_id`, `thumbnail`/`images` CDN URLs, `homepage_theme`.

### 1C. Photos

- **Minimum 7** per product: 1 hero, 1 thumbnail, ≥5 gallery. Ideal 10–15.
- Roles for `uploadImage`: `hero`, `thumbnail`, `gallery-01`…`gallery-15`, `detail-01`…`detail-05`, `video-01`…`video-05`, `gif-01`…`gif-05`. Use `skip_transform=true` for videos and GIFs.
- Shots: hero (clean front, = thumbnail), angles (3–4), details (2–3), lighting modes (2–3), one scale reference, 1–2 lifestyle.
- The system crops to 4:5, converts to WebP, compresses, and uploads to the CDN. She just sends the photos.

### 1D. Order & fulfillment protocol (what the GPT does for orders)

The GPT is Emy's whole console — it handles fulfillment too, not just products.

- **View orders** (`listOrders`): no filter = all orders newest-first; `status=needs_shipping` = paid orders awaiting shipping; `status=shipped` = already sent; `q=` searches by order id, customer email, or tracking number. Read results back to her plainly (who, what, address, total, shipped/not).
- **Mark shipped + send tracking** (`markShipped`): record a tracking number + carrier on an order. This **emails the buyer their tracking link automatically** and flips the order to `shipped`. The carrier MUST be exactly one of `USPS`, `UPS`, `FedEx`, `DHL` — normalize her wording ("the post office" → `USPS`). **Always confirm before calling** (it emails the buyer and can't be undone).
- **Find information**: use `listOrders` to answer "what did she order," "what's the shipping address," "did the tracking email send" (the order carries `tracking_email_sent_at`).

### 1E. Refunds (the GPT guides, but cannot execute)

The GPT has no refund Action in v1. When she wants to refund: tell her to do it in the **Stripe dashboard** (Payments → find the payment → Refund) — Stripe emails the buyer automatically. Note clearly: refunding does **not** automatically put the piece back up for sale. If she wants it available again, that's a separate manual relist (set `available = true`) via the **admin UI** or Supabase Studio (`createProduct` only makes *new* products). See `STORE_ADMINISTRATION.md`.

## Part 2 — The GPT configuration (paste-able)

### 2A. Instructions (system prompt) — paste verbatim into the Instructions field

```
You are "The Sunkeeper", the Everlastings by Emaline store assistant. You help Em (the artist) run her store — adding products and fulfilling orders. Talk to her like a warm, capable studio assistant. Never expose API keys, server URLs, or technical jargon unless she explicitly asks.

== ADDING A PRODUCT ==
1. Greet warmly. Ask what she wants to add.
2. Collect details conversationally. Required: title, headline (5–7 word tagline), story_card (2–8 poetic paragraphs), description (2–3 sentences), features (list), price in dollars, product_type (miniature / printable / storybook). Optional: dimensions, weight, materials (list), power_supply, care_instructions (list), shipping_details (list), series (Portals to Peace / Book Nooks / Story Lofts / Seasonal / Limited Edition / new), available, quantity, featured, artist_note.
3. Ask for photos — at least 7 total (1 hero, 1 thumbnail, ≥5 gallery). Drag-and-drop is fine. Upload each via the uploadImage action with the right role (hero, thumbnail, gallery-01…gallery-15, detail-01…05, video-01…05, gif-01…05). Use skip_transform=true for videos and GIFs. Use the slug derived from the title (lowercase, spaces become hyphens).
4. Show a clean preview before creating: title, price (in dollars), headline, all photo URLs grouped by role. Ask "Look right?"
5. On confirmation, call createProduct with sync=true. Convert materials, features, care_instructions, shipping_details to arrays of strings. Price goes in CENTS ($245 → 24500) — but always show her dollars.
6. After success, give her the live link: https://everlastingsbyemaline.com/product/{slug}.
Product rules: never create without showing the preview; never set a price different from what she said; never proceed with fewer than 7 photos; never edit an existing product (direct her to the admin UI); on 409 (slug taken) suggest a new title; on 400 tell her exactly which field is missing in plain language; on 401 stop and say "the connection key needs Sean's attention."

== FULFILLING ORDERS ==
When she asks about orders, shipping, or a customer:
1. Use listOrders to find orders. status=needs_shipping = awaiting shipping; status=shipped = already sent; q = search by order id, email, or tracking number. Read results back plainly.
2. To mark an order shipped: get the tracking number and carrier from her. The carrier MUST be exactly one of USPS, UPS, FedEx, DHL — normalize her wording (e.g. "the post office" → USPS). Confirm first: "Mark <product> shipped via <carrier> <tracking> and email <buyer>?" — markShipped emails the buyer automatically and can't be undone. Then call markShipped with the order id, tracking_number, and tracking_carrier.
3. To answer "what did they order / what's their address / did the tracking email send," read it from listOrders.
Order rules: always confirm before markShipped; never invent a tracking number or carrier; if markShipped returns email_sent:false, tell her the tracking saved but the email didn't send and to text Sean.

== REFUNDS ==
You cannot issue refunds. Tell her to refund in the Stripe dashboard (Payments → find the payment → Refund); Stripe emails the buyer automatically. Refunding does NOT relist the piece — if she wants it for sale again she relists it (available = true) via the admin UI. Don't promise the website does this automatically.

== VOICE (when you write copy) ==
Everlastings sounds warm, poetic, and quietly magical — like a gentle embrace, drawn from light, home, memory, and the seasons. Never clinical or sales-y. Lead with emotion, then specifics. Lean on: haven, sanctuary, Elsewhere, portal, glow, gentle, still, hold, keep, healing. Avoid: cute, perfect, sale/deal/discount, "escape," sad/tragic. For the full voice + the story-card shape consult your Knowledge file "voice-guide"; for field details + the worked example consult "product-reference."

== ALWAYS ==
Keep her in plain, warm language. Never reveal API keys, server URLs, or technical detail unless she asks.

### 2C. Authentication

- **Type:** API Key · **Auth Type:** Bearer · **API Key:** the **production** `PRODUCT_API_KEY` (Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables → `PRODUCT_API_KEY`, **Production** scope). Never the preview value.
- One key authorizes all four actions (`/api/products`, `/api/upload`, and — after `v1_4_9` Phase 6 — `/api/orders`).

### 2D. Settings

- **Name:** `The Sunkeeper` · **Description:** `Everlastings by Emaline store assistant — adds products and fulfills orders by chat.`
- **Capabilities:** Web Browsing off, DALL·E off, Code Interpreter on (lets it inspect uploaded images if needed).
- **Privacy policy URL:** `https://everlastingsbyemaline.com/privacy`
- **Share:** **Only me** (it carries a live API key — never public).
- **Knowledge files (required):** upload the two curated files **`assets/docs/gpt/product-reference.md`** and **`assets/docs/gpt/voice-guide.md`**. Do **not** upload `BRAND.md`, `EVERLASTINGS_STORE.md`, or `STORE_ADMINISTRATION.md` — they carry developer/CSS/architecture detail that confuses the GPT and risks leaking technical jargon to Em. (Role context is already in the Instructions; the GPT doesn't need the human operator how-to.)

---

## Part 3 — Setup, in two waves (Sean drives; Em at the keyboard)

The GPT lives in **Em's** ChatGPT (she has Plus; she's the owner). It's built in **two waves** for two reasons learned the hard way: the order Actions depend on the `/api/orders` Bearer path that **shipped in v1.4.9 (Phase 6)**, and a third-party Actions runner **cannot authenticate through a Vercel SSO-protected preview** — so each wave is verified against an environment the GPT can actually call (point the Action at the dev preview to test, production to hand off — see the Status note's environment rule). Don't configure an Action you can't immediately verify.

### Wave 1 — Products (do anytime; `/api/upload` + `/api/products` already accept the Bearer key)

1. ChatGPT → **Explore GPTs → Create → Configure**.
2. Paste **Name** + **Description** (2D).
3. Paste **Instructions** (2A) verbatim.
4. **Capabilities** per 2D. **Knowledge:** upload `assets/docs/gpt/product-reference.md` + `assets/docs/gpt/voice-guide.md` (2D) — never the raw dev docs.
5. **Create new action → Authentication:** API Key, Bearer, paste the `PRODUCT_API_KEY` for the environment you'll verify against (see the smoke test).
6. **Schema:** paste the YAML (2B) verbatim (whitespace-sensitive — copy clean). You may paste the full schema now; the `/api/orders` Actions simply won't work until Wave 2.
7. **Privacy URL** (2D). **Save → Only me**.
8. **Wave 1 smoke test** — because the GPT can't reach the SSO-protected preview, verify the product pipeline one of two ways:
   - **Recommended (no live clutter):** Sean curls the **dev preview** first to prove the pipeline (test key from `.env.local`). A bogus-key call → `401` (proves the endpoint is deployed + gated); a real-key `createProduct?sync=true` tags the row `is_test=true`. The GPT wraps these exact calls — green curl = green GPT path.
   - **GPT end-to-end (at launch):** point the schema `servers:` + key at **production**, then have the GPT add "Setup Smoke Test, $1," drag in 7 throwaway photos → it uploads 7×, previews, then `createProduct` with `sync=true` → `prod_…` id. Open `https://everlastingsbyemaline.com/product/setup-smoke-test`, then archive it (Stripe → archive product; Supabase Studio → set `available=false` or delete).

### Wave 2 — Orders (the `/api/orders` Bearer path shipped in v1.4.9; verify it on the environment the GPT targets)

The order Actions (`listOrders`, `markShipped`) need the `PRODUCT_API_KEY` Bearer path on `/api/orders`, which **Phase 6 ships**. Until it's deployed to the environment the GPT targets, these Actions return `401` — this is exactly the trap from the earlier attempt, so honor the gate:

1. **Confirm Phase 8.7 passed** on the target environment (Sean curls `/api/orders` GET + PATCH with that environment's key → `200`).
2. GPT → **Edit → Actions → Schema:** confirm the `/api/orders` + `/api/orders/{id}` paths are present (2B).
3. **Wave 2 smoke test** (with Em watching): "What orders need shipping?" → it calls `listOrders` and reads them back plainly. Then mark a **test** order shipped → it confirms first, calls `markShipped`, the order flips to shipped and the buyer tracking email fires. **A "test order" exists only on the dev preview** — point the GPT there to rehearse with `is_test` data and no real money. In **production** there are no test orders; for a launch sanity check, make one $1 throwaway purchase, ship it via the GPT, then refund + archive. Never mark a real customer's order as a rehearsal.

**Hand-off:** the GPT is in Em's sidebar. Remind her: always ≥7 photos; it always previews before creating; today it creates products and handles orders (**product editing + draft preview + coupons arrive in v1.5**; until then, edits are in the admin UI); it confirms before marking shipped (that emails the buyer); if she ever sees "the connection key needs Sean's attention," text Sean.

**Maintenance:** if `PRODUCT_API_KEY` rotates, reopen the GPT → Actions → Authentication → paste the new value → Save — nothing else changes. If the API base URL changes, update the `servers:` URL in the schema (2B).

## Part 4 — Agentic / curl protocol (Claude Code, Cursor, scripts, Sean)

> **Audience:** an AI/agent that executes HTTP directly (Claude Code, ChatGPT code interpreter, scripts), or Sean seeding test data. For Emy's chat workflow, that's Parts 1–3 (the Custom GPT wraps these same calls).

### Base URL

| Use case                          | `BASE_URL`                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Real product creation (default)   | `https://everlastingsbyemaline.com`                                                                  |
| Test/dev seeding (preview deploy) | `https://everlastings-website-git-dev-everlastingsbyemaline.vercel.app` (any `*.vercel.app` preview) |
| Local (`vercel dev`)              | `http://localhost:3000`                                                                              |

```bash
export BASE_URL="https://everlastingsbyemaline.com"        # production
# export BASE_URL="https://everlastings-website-git-dev-everlastingsbyemaline.vercel.app"  # dev preview
```

When `BASE_URL` is a preview, the API tags rows `is_test = true` and uploads under R2's `test/` namespace (URLs become `…/test/{slug}/test_{role}-{slug}.webp`); no cleanup needed before launch. `PRODUCT_API_KEY` differs per environment — use the test value from `.env.local` for previews, the production value only for production.

### Step 0 — Generate slug (FIRST, before any image upload)
```
slug = title.toLowerCase().replaceAll(' ', '-')   # "The Sunkeeper" → "the-sunkeeper"
```
Immutable after creation; used in image paths and the URL; 409 if it already exists.

### Step 1 — Required fields
`title`, `headline`, `story_card`, `description`, `features` (array), `price` (cents), `product_type`. Optional: `dimensions`, `weight`, `materials`/`care_instructions`/`shipping_details` (arrays), `power_supply`, `series`, `available` (default true), `quantity` (default 1), `featured` (default false), `artist_note`.

### Step 2 — Upload images
The endpoint composes the filename as `{role}-{slug}.{ext}` and handles the Cloudinary transform internally.
```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/api/upload" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PRODUCT_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/raw-image.jpg" \
  -F "slug=the-sunkeeper" \
  -F "role=hero"
# → { "url": "https://cdn.everlastingsbyemaline.com/products/the-sunkeeper/hero-the-sunkeeper.webp" }

# Videos / GIFs — skip the transform:
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/api/upload" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PRODUCT_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@clip.mp4" -F "slug=the-sunkeeper" -F "role=video-01" -F "skip_transform=true"
```
Roles: `hero`, `thumbnail`, `gallery-01..gallery-15`, `detail-01..05`, `video-01..05`, `gif-01..05`.

### Step 3 — Create product (use `?sync=true` for inline Stripe IDs)
```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/api/products?sync=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PRODUCT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "The Sunkeeper",
    "slug": "the-sunkeeper",
    "headline": "A garden where time stands still",
    "story_card": "The Sunkeeper stands watch...",
    "description": "Handcrafted miniature garden scene with warm LED lighting.",
    "features": ["Warm LED glow with 3 modes", "Hand-placed dried botanicals"],
    "materials": ["Wood", "resin", "natural moss"],
    "care_instructions": ["Dust gently with a soft brush", "Keep away from direct sunlight"],
    "shipping_details": ["Ships within 3-5 business days", "Insured shipping included"],
    "price": 24500,
    "product_type": "miniature",
    "series": "Portals to Peace",
    "images": [
      {"url": "https://cdn.everlastingsbyemaline.com/products/the-sunkeeper/hero-the-sunkeeper.webp", "alt": "Front view"},
      {"url": "https://cdn.everlastingsbyemaline.com/products/the-sunkeeper/gallery-01-the-sunkeeper.webp", "alt": "Side angle"}
    ],
    "thumbnail": "https://cdn.everlastingsbyemaline.com/products/the-sunkeeper/thumbnail-the-sunkeeper.webp",
    "seo_title": "The Sunkeeper | Everlastings by Emaline",
    "seo_description": "Handcrafted miniature garden scene with warm LED lighting."
  }'
# → { "success": true, "product": {...}, "stripe_sync": { "success": true, "stripe_product_id": "prod_…", "stripe_price_id": "price_…" } }
```
The sync helper is idempotent: the Supabase DB webhook still fires after the inline path but sees the IDs already set and no-ops. On a **preview** the DB webhook points at production, so test-mode seeding will not auto-sync — **always use `?sync=true` on previews.**

### Editing / marking sold (PUT)
```bash
# Non-price fields:
curl -X PUT "$BASE_URL/api/products?id=PRODUCT_UUID" -H "Authorization: Bearer $PRODUCT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"headline": "Updated tagline", "featured": false}'
# Price change (archives old Stripe price, creates new):
curl -X PUT "$BASE_URL/api/products?id=PRODUCT_UUID" -H "Authorization: Bearer $PRODUCT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"price": 29500}'
# Mark sold (also happens automatically on purchase):
curl -X PUT "$BASE_URL/api/products?id=PRODUCT_UUID" -H "Authorization: Bearer $PRODUCT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"available": false, "quantity": 0}'
```

### Error handling
- **Image upload fails:** retry once; if it fails again, STOP — do not create the product with missing images.
- **Create fails:** do NOT blind-retry. `409` = slug conflict; `400` = missing/invalid field; `401` = wrong/missing key.
- **Rollback:** if the product was created but images are incomplete, set `available = false` immediately.

### API quick reference
| Action         | Method | Endpoint                           |
| -------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Create product | POST   | `/api/products` (add `?sync=true`) |
| Update product | PUT    | `/api/products?id=UUID`            |
| Get product    | GET    | `/api/products?slug=SLUG`          |
| Upload image   | POST   | `/api/upload`                      |
| List orders    | GET    | `/api/orders` (`?status=`, `?q=`)  |
| Mark shipped   | PATCH  | `/api/orders/{id}`                 |

> **Auth modes.** `/api/products` and `/api/upload` accept `Authorization: Bearer` as either `PRODUCT_API_KEY` (AI/curl/Custom GPT) **or** a Supabase JWT (admin UI signed-in user). As of v1.4.9, **`/api/orders` and `/api/orders/{id}` also accept `PRODUCT_API_KEY`** (the Bearer path added in `v1_4_9_FINISH_TRACK_C.md` Phase 6, comparing the trimmed `env('PRODUCT_API_KEY')`) in addition to the admin JWT — that's what lets the Custom GPT fulfill orders. `PRODUCT_API_KEY` is per-environment (test in `.env.local`, live in Production); never ship it to the browser.

> **`npx vercel curl` quirk:** against a protection-enabled preview, the underlying `curl` exits code `3` ("No host part in the URL") even on success; the JSON body still delivers. In `set -e` scripts use `set -uo pipefail` or `|| true`.
